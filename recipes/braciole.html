    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Thinly sliced beef (flank steak or top round)</li>
        <li>Breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>Grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Minced garlic</li>
        <li>Chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>Pine nuts</li>
        <li>Raisins (optional)</li>
        <li>Tomato sauce (marinara sauce or tomato gravy)</li>
        <li>Extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>Cooking twine</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Fresh basil or parsley for garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
         <li>Prepare the stuffing by combining breadcrumbs, grated Parmesan cheese, minced garlic, chopped fresh parsley, pine nuts, and optional raisins in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Place the thinly sliced beef on a flat surface and spread the stuffing mixture evenly over each slice.</li>
        <li>Tightly roll up each slice of beef, enclosing the stuffing, and secure the rolls with cooking twine to hold their shape.</li>
        <li>Heat some extra-virgin olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Sear the braciole rolls in the skillet until they develop a golden-brown crust on all sides. This step helps lock in the flavors and juices.</li>
        <li>Lower the heat, and carefully add tomato sauce (marinara sauce or tomato gravy) to the skillet, enough to cover the braciole rolls.</li>
        <li>Cover the skillet and let the braciole simmer in the sauce for about 1.5 to 2 hours, or until the beef is tender and fully cooked.</li>
        <li>Once cooked, remove the cooking twine from the braciole rolls and discard them.</li>
        <li>Serve the braciole hot, accompanied by pasta (such as spaghetti or rigatoni) and topped with the simmered tomato sauce.</li>
        <li>Garnish with fresh basil or parsley for an extra burst of color and flavor.</li>
        <li>Enjoy your delicious and comforting Braciole with your loved ones!</li>
    </ol>
