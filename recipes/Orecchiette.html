        <li>1 bunch of fresh broccoli rabe (rapini)</li>
        <li>3 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes (adjust to taste)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup (60ml) extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (120ml) vegetable broth or white wine</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (50g) grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Sun-dried tomatoes (optional, for added flavor)</li>
        <li>Toasted pine nuts (optional, for added crunch)</li>
        <li>Fresh lemon juice (optional, for a tangy twist)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the orecchiette pasta and cook it according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>While the pasta is cooking, prepare the broccoli rabe by trimming the tough ends and any large leaves. Blanch the broccoli rabe in a separate pot of boiling salted water for about 2-3 minutes until it becomes tender. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, heat the extra-virgin olive oil over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and red pepper flakes, and sauté until the garlic becomes golden and fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the blanched broccoli rabe to the skillet and sauté it with the garlic oil for a few minutes until the flavors meld together.</li>
        <li>Pour in the vegetable broth or white wine, and let the mixture simmer for an additional 2-3 minutes until the broccoli rabe is tender-crisp.</li>
        <li>Add the cooked orecchiette pasta to the skillet with the broccoli rabe mixture. Toss everything together, ensuring the pasta is well coated with the flavors.</li>
        <li>Stir in the grated Parmesan cheese, and season the dish with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste. Toss again to combine.</li>
        <li>If desired, add optional ingredients such as sun-dried tomatoes, toasted pine nuts, or a squeeze of fresh lemon juice to enhance the dish's flavor and texture.</li>
        <li>Serve the Orecchiette with Broccoli Rabe hot, and garnish with additional Parmesan cheese and a drizzle of olive oil, if desired.</li>
