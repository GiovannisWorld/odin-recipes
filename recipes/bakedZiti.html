        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the ziti pasta according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl, mix together ricotta cheese, beaten eggs, grated Parmesan cheese, and a portion of the shredded mozzarella cheese. This mixture serves as the filling.</li>
            <li>Brown ground beef or sausage in a skillet (optional). Once cooked, drain any excess grease and add marinara sauce to the meat. Let it simmer for a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to a specified temperature (usually around 375°F or 190°C).</li>
            <li>In a baking dish, spread a layer of the meat sauce at the bottom.</li>
            <li>Layer half of the cooked ziti over the sauce.</li>
            <li>Spread the ricotta cheese mixture evenly on top of the ziti layer.</li>
            <li>Add another layer of ziti on top of the ricotta mixture.</li>
            <li>Pour the remaining meat sauce over the second ziti layer, ensuring it's evenly distributed.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the remaining shredded mozzarella cheese on top of the meat sauce.</li>
            <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10-15 minutes or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
            <li>Let the baked ziti cool slightly before serving, and garnish with fresh basil or parsley if desired.</li>
        </ol>
